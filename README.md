# MySQL_Data_Analysis_Project
I love to learn :)

## About This Project
This project showcases my SQL skills acquired during an **IBM course**. The data used in this repository, provided by IBM as part of the coursework. Through various assignments, I gained hands-on experience working with relational databases, performing complex data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis using SQL.

## SQL Queries
### 1. Maximum Waste per Station

This query identifies the highest `Waste` value for each unique station and the corresponding date when this maximum was recorded. It leverages the `RANK()` window function to achieve this.
